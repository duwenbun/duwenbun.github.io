"The narrative visualization follows the hybrid structure of an interactive slideshow. The layout of this visualization is that of two scenes using two different kinds of charts. Like with any dataset, it is important to look at data from multiple "angles". The stacked bar chart in Scene 1 is useful for identifying the crime rate of a particular crime as it relates to the other crimes for a given max temperature. While the area chart in Scene 2 does a better job at identifying how a particular crime relates to the others across the entire temperature range. This information can be easily extracted from the area chart by comparing the area under the curve for each crime.

In Scene 1, annotations are used to identify two very interesting phenomena that occur in Chicago crime. The first is the crime rate peak when the max temperature outside is 80F. An outside temperature of 80F would be described as a day with good weather. On days with good weather, more people are usually outdoors at events, parties, gatherings, etc. With more people outside, there is an understandable increase in crime rates. The second annotated data item is the significant dip in crime rates at 100F. When temperatures are 100F or above, people tend to stay indoors away from the heat, which causes an understandable decrease in crime rates. In the second Scene 2




The dataset I used was taken from the Chicago Police Department's open data API, and it is a record of all the crimes that were reported in Chicago on each day. The raw data was processed by a blogger to include the date, max temperature of the day, and a count of all the difference crimes that were reported that day. This processed data, however, is sorted by date, and I was interested in sorting it by max temperature. First, I rounded the max temperature to the nearest whole number in Microsoft Excel. Then, I wrote a Python script using the NumPy library to average all the entries that had the same temperature value.

The conclusion that should be drawn from my visualization is that crime rates in Chicago are very well correlated with the outside temperature from 15 to 90 degrees F. Interestingly, when outside temperatures are above 90 degrees F, there is a dip in crime. The data also shows that below 15 degrees F, there is a slight spike in crime, but this could be attributed to other reasons such as the holiday season. For example, I noticed that New Year's Eve and New Year's Day typically have high crime rates despite the weather being cold on those days."
